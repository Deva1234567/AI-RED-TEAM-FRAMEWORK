Automated red teaming tool for testing Large Language Models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks such as **prompt injection**, **jailbreaks**, and **policy bypasses**. Inspired by **MITRE ATLAS** framework and real-world offensive security practices.

This project builds on my background in web application penetration testing (OWASP Top 10), vulnerability assessment, and bug bounty hunting.

## 🚀 Features (Week 1 MVP)
- FastAPI backend for API-driven red teaming
- Local LLM inference using **Ollama** (phi3:mini – fully private, no cloud dependency)
- Generates 10+ diverse attack payloads (hard-coded + dynamically generated by LLM)
- Creative evasion techniques (e.g., narrative/poetic jailbreaks to bypass filters)
- Modular structure for future extensions

A complete **AI Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)** platform for red teaming Large Language Models (LLMs). Built with a focus on **MITRE ATLAS**, **OWASP LLM Top 10**, and real-world adversarial testing workflows.

This tool enables security analysts to perform **automated red team campaigns**, **manual attack crafting**, **deep investigation**, and **executive-level reporting** — all in a local, private, and offline-capable environment.

## Features

- **Automated Red Team Simulation**  
  Launch large-scale attack campaigns with configurable payload counts, mutation types (e.g., paraphrase, obfuscation), and defense hardening via system prompts.

- **Manual Attack Lab**  
  Craft custom payloads, mutate them, mark severity, and execute attacks interactively against any supported LLM.

- **Investigation Workspace**  
  Detailed case-by-case analysis with full request/response history, MITRE ATLAS classification, refusal quality scoring, and analyst notes.

- **Executive Report Builder**  
  Automated findings summary with total vulnerabilities, severity breakdown, resilience scoring, and JSON export for compliance.

- **Visual Analytics**  
  Interactive charts (bypass rate pie chart, timelines, severity distribution) for quick insights.

- **Local & Private Deployment**  
  Runs fully offline with local models (e.g., Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers). No data leaves your machine.
